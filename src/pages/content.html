    <h1>Content and information architecture</h1>

    <h2>Content may take many forms. Creating an inventory of current content helps us see the bigger picture.</h2>

        <p>Content is the basis and foundation of digital products. Design must always build on content. Never create content based on design.
          A good inventory of content gives us the breadth and depth of the material we need to serve to the people targeted.

        </br></br>What types of content do we have? How do we structure and present the content so that our target people can find it and use it to meet their needs? An "as-is" information architecture will provide a starting point for the "to-be" solution. Is the current IA clear and well-structured? Is each type of content rigidly defined? Is there for example a clear distinction between section pages and article pages, or are there hybrids? Are some page structures too deep, others too shallow?</p>
