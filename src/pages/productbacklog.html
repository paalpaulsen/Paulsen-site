        <p>Frequently we hear that a product or service is launched. In reality, if done correctly, this is not one product, but a collection of many products and components. Building a well structured product backlog is about creating an appropriate number of self-contained, self-deployable, relatively independent "packages".

        </br></br>Like LEGO, these "blocks" of functionality can be combined in a number of ways, together building the product. As a UX designer, I break a design down into logical components, ready for a well-groomed product backlog.</p>
