        <p>The scope of the project was to create a responsive website based on the original content.
          However, after carefully reviewing the information architecture and content, extensive content and structure improvements had to be made.



        </br></br>The final solution was well received both internally in PSA and externally by users. With a revamped design and fluid responsiveness
        to everything from mobile phones to large office screens, the solution gave the whole organisation a positive facelift. My roles included
        information architecture, interaction design, responsive wireframe prototyping, concept development, content strategy and a focus group workshop.
