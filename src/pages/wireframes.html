        <p>The value of meeting the people we design for cannot be underestimated.
          The temptation to assume things about our users is no doubt strong.

          Face to face conversations tend to be the most effective ways of connecting.
          Often I have invited target users to group meetings, which also seems to engage people in fruitful conversation.</p>
