        <p>The need to wireframe a digital solution from the very beginning has never been more urgent. The reason is that we need to be in a functional state of mind, in order to focus on the needs and tasks of our target people. We need to let our mind be as purely dedicated as possible on what, how and why.

        </br></br>The aesthetics will have to wait until the functionality is completely obvious and intuitive. Building graphic design on a wireframe is far better than to try to build functions with a "look and feel" mindset. </p>
