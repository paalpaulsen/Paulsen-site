        <p>The mandate of the project was to build a web publishing framework based on SharePoint 2013.
          The most important feature was a geological database with interactive maps over the North Atlantic continental shelf.
          The intranet framework was created first to establish a responsive web publishing foundation.



        </br></br>The  innovative responsive solution was based on SharePoint 2013 and the new FAST-based SP search engine. My role included
        information architecture, interaction design, responsive wireframe prototyping and concept development.
