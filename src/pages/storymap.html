        <p>The value of meeting the people we design for cannot be underestimated.
          The temptation to assume things about our users is no doubt strong.
          Even the most experienced designers sometimes fail miserably when making assumptions.

        </br></br>User research can take many forms, depending on the product we are creating.
          Face to face conversations tend to be the most effective ways of connecting.
          Often I have invited target users to group meetings, which also seems to engage people in fruitful conversation.</p>
