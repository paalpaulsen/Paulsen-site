        <p>A design system is like a warehouse storing all the parts we need to build our product or service. The aim with a design system is to simplify and unify. Building on classic brand elements like typography and colors, we can extend this library of components to include all elements big and small.

        </br></br>A design system should include everything from grids, spacing, navigation, image sizes and page layouts to smaller elements like buttons, bullets, tables, form elements and icons.</p>
