        <p>The My Page project aims to promote self service for the Norwegian Maritime Authority's customers.
          Aligned with a vision to digitize key processes and services, the project objective is to simplify
          the tasks of mariners, sailors, ship owners, shipyards, education providers, private boat owners and others.


        </br></br>My roles included user story mapping, responsive wireframe prototyping, test case writing, concept development, usability testing and content creation.
        The project is now being realised by my company Capgemini.
